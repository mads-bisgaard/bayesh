# bayesh
A faster and more efficient way to use your shell history.

## Description
Bayesh suggests commands to you in your Bash shell (using fzf). This is done by maintaining a database of your shell history and suggesting you relevant commands based on a statistical model.

## Usage
The recommended way to use bayesh is by setting up a keybinding in bash (see below). When you hit the bound key(s) bayesh will recommend you the shell commands relevant to the context you are in. Bayesh will need to learn a bit about your workflows, so suggestions will improve after a learning phase.

## Installation
The following has been tested on Fedora and Ubuntu:
1. Ensure the dependencies are installed ([fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and [python3](https://www.python.org/))
2. clone this repository
3. run `bash install.bash` from the root of this repository.
4. Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc`
```bash
source "<bayesh root dir>/shell/bayesh.bash"
bind -x '"\C-e":"bayesh_infer_cmd"'
```
Now you should be able to generate bash predictions by pressing `Ctrl+e` in your bash terminal. Probably you don't see any predictions at first, but after some time it will have collected enough data to (hopefully) generate great predictions.

## Gotchas and known limitations
- Bayesh uses the Bash `histroy` builtin to determine when a new command is executed and when not. It is adviced to add `export HISTCONTROL=` in your `~/.bashrc` (see [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#index-HISTCONTROL)) to ensure that, when you execute the same command twice in a row it is visible in your bash history that you ran it twice. You can check that this is the case by running `history 1` twice in your bash shell and check that the two lines printed are different (either because they display different timestamps or history event numbers).
